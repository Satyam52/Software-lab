## Points to remember while testing the app

1. **Register/Login** before posting any auction
2. In case any **user is not broadcasted** it is probably due to server overload, **REFRESH** the window to solve this. 
3. Make sure the **URL** is starting with https
4. While **scheduling a meet** make sure the start and end date follow a logical sequence or else itâ€™ll show an error. 
5. While testing the **Posture** bot, allow permissions for the camera and allow **notifications**, and **REFRESH** the page for changes to take effect. 
6. Wait for the model to analyze, and check for **notifications**
